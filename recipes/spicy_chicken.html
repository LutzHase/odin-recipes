        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 220 °C top/bottom heat or 200 °C convection oven. 
                Peel washed potatoes as desired and cut into finger-thick wedges. 
                Spread potato wedges on a baking sheet lined with baking paper. 
                Spread 1 tbsp oil and 1 pinch of salt on top and bake for 30 - 35 min. 
                After 25 minutes, turn the wedges over and sprinkle with hard cheese. 
                Finish baking until cheese is crisp and lightly browned. 
                Meanwhile, continue with recipe.
            </li>
            <li>Peel carrots and grate coarsely into a bowl. 
                Halve lettuce heart and cut into fine strips and also add to the bowl. 
                Wash lime hot and finely grate 1 tsp of the peel. 
                Add 1 tbsp lime juice to the bowl and mix everything with honey, mayonnaise and 1 tbsp oil. 
                Season with salt and pepper and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the meantime, place chicken breasts individually between 2 sheets of plastic wrap 
                and flatten either with a rolling pin or a frying pan so that they are only about 2 cm thick. 
                Cut flattened chicken breasts into 6 to 7 long strips and salt.
            </li>             
            <li>
                In a second large bowl, mix 2 tablespoons flour with 0.5 teaspoon lime zest, 
                Paprika spice mixture and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. 
                Mix everything well. Add chicken strips to flour mixture and coat thoroughly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. 
                Tip: Let the oil get really hot so the chicken strips get nice and crispy. 
                Fry half of the chicken strips in the pan until everything is golden brown, 
                3 - 4 min. on each side. Transfer to a plate covered with paper towels and cover with foil. 
                Repeat with remaining chicken strips. Season with a little salt when cooked.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reheat chicken strips in oven for a few minutes if needed. 
                Coarsely grate the tomato into a small bowl and mix with the ketchup. 
                Serve chicken strips together with the ketchup, potato wedges and salad. 
                Enjoy your meal!
